# Omnirig Playground
This is a personal learning area for me to cull my notes on coding for the omnirig. 

For some reason, I couldn't find a single source for omnirig operation so I'll I had to pull examples from other repositories to discover these methods

The first application I coded was for python so most of the information here will go focused on that language.
