# POTA2RIG
Project intent is to take the spotting data from pota.app and feed rigcontrol and logging software

Intial project thoughts:
take JSON from http://api.pota.app/spots convert to table 

Found another project that have very similar functionality called Augratin. Will look into that, possibly fork it over here and play.
